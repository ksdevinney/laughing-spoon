# TRVL App

This is an app created using React in order to practice using states, components, react-router-dom, and props. The app is based on a fictional upscale travel agency. Each component contains styling and images.

My biggest challenge when creating this app was to link images correctly to each page- React has different rules than traditional HTML/CSS/JS. In the future, I plan to add more content to this, in order to practice making more complete pages.
